"""starts a Flask web application:
Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine 
(FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
To load all cities of a State:
If your storage engine is DBStorage, you must use cities relationship
Otherwise, use the public getter method cities
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/hbnb_filters: display a HTML page like 6-index.html, which was done during the project 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition
